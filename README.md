## Auto-Completion

Auto-completion is supported for at least the following shells:

```bash
bash
fish
powershell
zsh
```

NOTE: it may work for other shells as well because the implementation is in
Golang and is not necessarily shell-specific.

### Completion

Installing auto-completions is as simple as running one command (works for
`bash`, `fish`, `powershell` and `zsh` shells):

```bash
tomba completion zsh
```
